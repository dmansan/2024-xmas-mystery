2024 XMAS Mystery - Deployment Instructions

This project is an interactive web-based mystery game where users solve clues, input a passcode, and interact with a leaderboard. Successful participants see a congratulatory message, and the leaderboard is updated to reflect their achievement.

**Architecture Overview**

The architecture includes:  
- Frontend: A static website hosted on AWS S3.  
-	Backend: Two AWS Lambda functions handle leaderboard operations (fetching and updating data).  
-	API Gateway: Provides REST endpoints for communication between the frontend and backend.  
-	S3 Bucket: Stores the leaderboard data in a JSON file.  

---

**Deployment Steps**

1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following:  
-	AWS CLI installed and configured with your credentials.  
- Node.js installed for packaging Lambda functions.  
- Permissions to create and manage:  
  - S3 Buckets
  - Lambda Functions
  - API Gateway

---

2. S3 Setup

**a. Create an S3 Bucket**  
  1.	Log in to the AWS Management Console.
  2.	Navigate to S3 and create a new bucket:
    	- Name: `2024-xmas-mystery` (or your preferred name) | You will need this bucket name to match in the lambdas code  
    	- Region: Pick a preferred AWS region.  
    	- Enable Static Website Hosting:
      		- Set the index document to index.html.
       	- Ensure public access is enabled for this bucket so it can accessed on public internet  

**b. Upload Frontend Files**  
  1.	Upload all the repo files, some are explained below:  
    	- congratulations.html = page that loads upon successful code entry
    	- index.html = landing page
    	- All associated images = clues & favicons
     	- leaderboard.json = starter json file for the leaderboard being blank

     
**c. Test Static Website**  
  1.	Note the bucket object endpoint for the index.html (e.g., `https://2024-xmas-mystery.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/index.html`). | the first portion will be based on your bucket name you set
  2.	Open the endpoint in a browser to ensure the site loads.

3. Lambda Functions

**a. GetLeaderboard Function**  
  1.	Navigate to AWS Lambda and create a new function:  
    	- 	Name: `GetLeaderboard`
     	- 	Runtime: `Node.js 18.x`
  2.	Paste the code from the GetLeaderboard.js file | don't forget to change the bucket  name in the code  
  3.	Update code environment variable:  
     	- 	const BUCKET_NAME: `your-bucket-name`
  4.	Deploy lambda function 

**b. UpdateLeaderboard Function**   
  1.	Create another Lambda function:
    	- 	Name: `UpdateLeaderboard`
     	- 	Runtime: `Node.js 18.x`
  2.	Paste the code from UpdateLeaderboard.js file | don't forget to change the bucket  name in the code
    	- 	This is where the passcode is set, in line 24. 
  3.	Update code environment variable:   
     	- 	const BUCKET_NAME: `your-bucket-name`| (dont forget to use your bucket name and replace in the arn for the bucket in json below  
  4.	Deploy lambda function  
  5.	Go to s3 bucket and Attach the following IAM policy (json) to allow read & write access to the S3 bucket:  
```javascript
	{
	    "Effect": "Allow",
	    "Action": ["s3:GetObject", "s3:PutObject"],
	    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/leaderboard.json"
	}
```

4. API Gateway


**a. Create API**
  1.	Navigate to API Gateway and create a **REST API**.
  2.	Add two endpoints: 
    	- 	**GET /get-leaderboard**
     		- Integrate this endpoint with the GetLeaderboard Lambda function.  
     	- 	**POST /update-leaderboard**
      		- Integrate this endpoint with the UpdateLeaderboard Lambda function.  

**b. Enable CORS**
  1.	Enable CORS for both endpoints to allow requests from the S3 frontend.

**c. Deploy the API**
  1.	Deploy the API to a new stage (e.g., prod).
  2.	Note the API Base URL (e.g., https://<api-id>.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod).

**d. Update Frontend API Endpoints**

- 	In index.html, update the API endpoints:

`const GET_API_ENDPOINT = '<API_BASE_URL>/get-leaderboard';`  
`const POST_API_ENDPOINT = '<API_BASE_URL>/update-leaderboard';`

---
5. Testing
	1.	Open the website using the S3 static hosting endpoint.
	2.	Verify the following functionalities:
    	- 	Clue toggling works as expected.
     	- 	Inputting the correct passcode displays the congratulatory message.
     	- 	The leaderboard updates correctly.
 	3.	Submit a correct and incorrect password to check both Lambda functions for successful execution.
